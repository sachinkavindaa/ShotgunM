# Shotgun Python Analysis Project

## Project Structure

- `Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook for data analysis and visualization.
- `hello.py` — Example Python script.
- `mappingfile.csv` — (Ignored in git) Data file for analysis. Not included in the repository.
- `Figures/` — Folder for saving plots and figures (e.g., `HvI.png`).
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Custom Copilot instructions for this workspace.
- `.vscode/` — VS Code settings and tasks.
- `README.md` — Project documentation (this file).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your own `mappingfile.csv` to the project root (not tracked by git).
3. Open `Analysis.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter and run the cells to perform analysis.
4. Figures and plots will be saved in the `Figures/` directory.

## Notes
- The `mappingfile.csv` file is required for analysis but is not included in the repository. Please provide your own data file.
- All dependencies should be installed in your Python environment (see notebook for details).
